            <p>
              In some regions (like the European Economic Area and the United

              or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal
              information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
              certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to
              the processing of your personal information. To make such a
              request, please use the contact details provided below. We will
              consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
              data protection laws.

              lawful processing grounds other than consent.
