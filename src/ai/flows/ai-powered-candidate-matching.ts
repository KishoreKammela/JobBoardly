Job Description:
{{{jobDescription}}}

Searchable Candidate Profiles:
{{{candidateProfiles}}}

Based on the provided information:
1.  Thoroughly analyze the job description, noting key responsibilities, required and preferred skills, language requirements (if any), experience level, location, job type, and salary range (if provided).
2.  Carefully review each candidate's profile. Pay close attention to their skills, languages, detailed work experience (roles, responsibilities, duration), education, stated preferences (preferred locations, desired salary in INR, job search status, availability), and any resume summary.
3.  Identify the candidate UIDs that are the MOST relevant matches for the job description.
4.  Provide a detailed reasoning for your selections. For each recommended candidate, explain how their profile aligns with the job's requirements. Highlight specific matches in skills, experience, education, languages, salary expectations (if their desired salary is compatible with the job's range or market rates), and location preferences. Also, note any potential minor misalignments if the overall match is strong.
5.  Return the UIDs of the matched candidates in the 'relevantCandidateIDs' array, ideally ordered by relevance (most relevant first).
6.  Ensure your output is a correctly formatted JSON object matching the defined output schema.

Prioritize candidates whose skills and experience closely align with the core requirements of the job description.
Consider factors like years of experience, specific technical skills, language proficiency, cultural fit (if discernible), and alignment of preferences (salary, location).
If no candidates are a strong match, return an empty 'relevantCandidateIDs' array and explain why in the 'reasoning' field.
