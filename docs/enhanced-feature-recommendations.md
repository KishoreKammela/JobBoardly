# JobBoardly: Enhanced Feature Recommendations

**Note:** This document previously contained a broad list of potential future enhancements. Most of these ideas have now been integrated into the **[Future Development Roadmap](./future-development-roadmap.md)**, which provides a more structured, phased approach to platform evolution.

Please refer to the **[Future Development Roadmap](./future-development-roadmap.md)** for a comprehensive overview of planned features, including those related to:

- Advanced AI Capabilities (also detailed in `docs/ai-features-roadmap.md`)
- Comprehensive Notification & Email System (detailed in `docs/notification-system-plan.md`)
- User Experience Improvements for Job Seekers and Employers
- Admin Panel Enhancements
- Mobile Experience
- Integrations & API
- And much more.

The **[Future Development Roadmap](./future-development-roadmap.md)** also discusses the necessary new technologies and third-party integrations required for these advancements.

**Key Prerequisite for New Features:**

As with other major feature sets, the availability of new enhancements to users will be contingent upon a **Platform Feature Toggle Management** system within the Admin Panel. This system is a high-priority item and will allow administrators (SuperAdmins/Admins) to enable or disable specific features globally or for specific user groups, ensuring controlled deployment.
