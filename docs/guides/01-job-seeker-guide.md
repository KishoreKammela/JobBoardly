# JobBoardly - Job Seeker Features Guide

Welcome to the JobBoardly Job Seeker Guide! This document details the features available to help you find your next career opportunity.

## 1. Core Goal

To provide job seekers with a comprehensive, AI-enhanced platform to manage their professional profile, search for relevant jobs, apply seamlessly, and track their job-seeking journey.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1. Authentication & Account Management

- **Secure Registration**: Sign up using Email/Password or social providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft). Includes password strength indicators.
- **Login**: Access your account securely. Post-login, you are correctly redirected to the appropriate page.
- **Change Password**: A dedicated page to update your account password. This action requires confirmation.
- **Account Status**: Your account can be 'active', 'suspended', or 'deleted' (by an admin).
  - **Suspended Accounts**: Can log in but have limited functionality. Cannot apply for jobs, edit main profile sections (like experience, education, skills), save jobs, or use AI job matcher. An alert will be displayed on relevant pages.
  - **Deleted Accounts**: Cannot log in. If Firebase Authentication succeeds, the application will immediately log the user out and display a message indicating the account is deactivated.

### 2.2. Profile Management (`/profile`)

- **Comprehensive Profile Sections**:
  - **Personal Information**: Name, Avatar, Mobile, Gender, Date of Birth, Home City/State.
  - **Professional Headline**: A short tagline to summarize your professional identity.
  - **Professional Summary**: A detailed summary of your career, often pre-filled by AI from your resume, or generated by AI based on your profile and a target.
  - **Skills**: List your technical and soft skills.
  - **Work Experience**: Add detailed entries for each role (Company, Job Role, Duration, Description, Annual CTC).
  - **Education**: Detail your educational qualifications (Level, Degree, Institute, Batch, Specialization, Course Type, Description). Mark your most relevant qualification.
  - **Languages**: Specify languages known with proficiency (Read, Write, Speak).
  - **Total Experience**: Calculated or manually entered total years and months of professional experience.
  - **Compensation**: Specify current and expected annual CTC (in INR), with options for confidentiality and negotiability.
  - **Preferences**: Set your `Notice Period` and preferred work locations.
  - **Links**: Portfolio URL, LinkedIn Profile URL.
- **Resume Management**:
  - **Upload Resume**: Upload your resume (PDF, DOCX, TXT). Processing this requires confirmation.
  - **Paste Resume Text**: Alternatively, paste your resume content directly. Processing this requires confirmation.
  - **AI Resume Parsing**: Our AI attempts to parse your resume (uploaded or pasted) to pre-fill sections of your profile like summary, skills, and potentially structure experience/education.
  - _Note_: Plain text (.txt or pasted) generally yields the best parsing results.
  - **Stored Resume**: Your uploaded resume file can be stored and downloaded. Removing the resume requires confirmation.
- **AI Summary Generator**:
  - Input a target role or company.
  - AI generates a tailored professional summary based on your profile data.
  - Option to copy the generated summary to your main profile summary field.
- **Profile Visibility**: Control whether your profile is searchable by employers or kept private.
- **Downloadable PDF Profile**: Download a clean, ATS-friendly PDF version of your profile (`/profile`).
- **Profile Preview (`/profile/preview`)**: See how your profile might appear to employers, with data reflecting your latest saved changes.
- **Saving Profile Changes**: Requires confirmation before updates are saved.
- _Note_: If your account is 'suspended', most profile editing features will be disabled, and saving changes will be blocked.

### 2.3. Job Discovery

- **Job Search & Filtering (`/jobs`)**:
  - Browse a comprehensive list of approved job postings.
  - **Filters**:
    - Keywords (searches title, company, skills, responsibilities, requirements).
    - Location, Role Type, Remote option, Recent Activity.
    - Salary Range (Min/Max).
    - Experience Level.
    - Minimum Years of Experience.
  - **Save Current Search**: Ability to save the current combination of search term and filters as a "Saved Search" with a custom name. (See Settings for management). Saving a search requires confirmation.
  - **View Modes**: Switch between Grid and List view for job listings.
- **Dynamic Job Detail Pages (`/jobs/[jobId]`)**:
  - View complete details for each job: `responsibilities`, `requirements`, qualifications, skills, salary, company info, and benefits.
  - **Share Functionality**: Copy a direct link to the job posting.
  - Screening questions are _not_ visible on the public job detail page.
- **Company Profile Pages (`/companies/[companyId]`)**:
  - View details about companies, including their open positions.

### 2.4. Application & Job Management

- **Apply for Jobs**:
  - Submit applications directly through the platform (only for 'approved' jobs).
  - If a job has **Screening Questions** (defined by the employer), you'll answer them (text, yes/no supported) during the application process via a modal. Answers are final once submitted with the application.
- **Re-application Prevention**: Once an application is submitted (even if later withdrawn or rejected by the company), you cannot re-apply for the same job. The "Apply Now" button will be disabled or show the current application status.
- **Withdraw Application**: From the "My Jobs" page or the job detail page, you can withdraw an active application at any stage before a final decision (e.g., 'Hired' or 'Rejected By Company') is made. This action requires confirmation. Withdrawn applications change status to 'Withdrawn by Applicant' and cannot be re-submitted.
- **Save Jobs**: Bookmark 'approved' jobs you're interested in for later review or application. This action is disabled if you have already applied for the job.
- **My Jobs Page (`/my-jobs`)**:
  - A centralized dashboard to view and manage:
    - **Saved Jobs**: Jobs you've bookmarked.
    - **Applied Jobs**: Jobs you've submitted applications for, showing their current status (e.g., Applied, Reviewed, Interviewing, Withdrawn by Applicant, Rejected By Company). The option to withdraw an active application is available here.
  - Filter jobs by status (All, Applied, Saved, Withdrawn).

### 2.5. AI-Powered Job Matching (`/ai-match`)

- Input or review your comprehensive profile summary (editable for the session).
- The AI matches your profile (including detailed work experience, education, skills, languages, preferences like salary, location, and `noticePeriod`) against all available approved job postings.
- Receive a list of relevant job IDs and a detailed reasoning for the matches.
- _Note_: Disabled if your account is 'suspended'.

### 2.6. User Settings (`/settings`)

- **Theme Customization**: Choose between Light, Dark, or System preference.
- **Notification Preferences**: Basic UI for toggling notification categories (backend triggers pending).
- **Manage Saved Searches**: View, apply, or delete saved job searches.
- **Job Board Display Preferences**: Set your default view (list/grid) and items per page.
- **Local Search History**: View and clear your device-specific search term history.

## 5. Key "API" Interactions (Data Flows with Genkit & Firebase)

Job seekers interact with AI features via Genkit flows and their profile data is stored in Firebase Firestore. Key actions like profile updates, resume processing, and managing saved searches require user confirmation.

- **Resume Parsing (`parseResumeFlow`):**

  - **Trigger**: User uploads a resume file (PDF, DOCX, TXT) or pastes resume text in `/profile` and confirms processing.
  - **Action**: A `POST` request is sent to an internal endpoint that invokes the `parseResumeFlow` Genkit flow. This flow takes the resume data URI as input.
  - **Backend**: The Genkit flow uses a Gemini model to analyze the document/text, extracting structured data like name, headline, skills, experience, and education.
  - **Response**: The flow returns a JSON object with the parsed data.
  - **Frontend**: The frontend receives the parsed data and uses it to pre-fill the corresponding fields in the profile form, which the user can then review and save.

- **AI-Powered Job Matching (`aiPoweredJobMatching`):**

  - **Trigger**: User navigates to `/ai-match` and clicks the "Get Matches" button. This is disabled if the user's account is suspended.
  - **Action**: The frontend compiles a comprehensive string representation of the user's profile (including experience, education, skills, salary preferences, notice period, etc.) and all available 'approved' job postings. This data is sent to the `aiPoweredJobMatching` Genkit flow.
  - **Backend**: The Genkit flow uses a Gemini model to perform a semantic match between the user's profile and the job postings. It considers a holistic view of skills, experience alignment, and preferences.
  - **Response**: The flow returns a JSON object containing an array of `relevantJobIDs` and a detailed `reasoning` string explaining why the matches were suggested.
  - **Frontend**: The UI displays the reasoning and a list of `JobCard` components for each matched job ID, allowing the user to view and interact with them.

- **AI Dynamic Summary Generation (`generateProfileSummaryFlow`):**

  - **Trigger**: User inputs a target role/company on the `/profile` page and clicks "Generate Summary with AI".
  - **Action**: The frontend sends the user's core profile data and the optional target role to the `generateProfileSummaryFlow` Genkit flow.
  - **Backend**: The Genkit flow instructs a Gemini model to act as a career coach and write a professional, tailored summary.
  - **Response**: The flow returns a JSON object with the `generatedSummary` string.
  - **Frontend**: The generated summary is displayed in a textarea. The user has an option to click "Use This Summary", which copies the text into their main profile summary field for them to save.

- **Profile & Application Data (Firebase Firestore):**

  - **User Profile**: All details entered in `/profile` are stored in the `users` collection. Profile updates require confirmation. Editing restricted if account 'suspended'.
  - **Job Application**: An `application` document is created in the `applications` collection, now including `answers` to screening questions. Disabled if account 'suspended'. Re-application to the same job by the same user is prevented by checking existing application status.
  - **Withdraw Application**: Updates the `status` of an existing `application` document to `'Withdrawn by Applicant'`. Requires confirmation.
  - **Saved Jobs/Searches**: Stored in the user's profile document (`savedJobIds` as string array, `savedSearches` as array of SavedSearch objects). Saving/unsaving jobs and saving/deleting searches disabled if account 'suspended' or job already applied for. Deleting saved searches requires confirmation.

- **Saving a Search:**

  - **Trigger**: User is on the `/jobs` page, has applied filters, and clicks the "Save Current Search" button in the sidebar. This is disabled if the user's account is suspended.
  - **Action**: A confirmation dialog prompts for a name for the search. Upon confirmation, a request is made to update the user's profile in Firestore.
  - **Backend (Firebase)**: The user's document in the `users` collection is updated. The new `SavedSearch` object (containing a unique ID, the user-defined name, the current filter state, and a timestamp) is added to the `savedSearches` array field using `arrayUnion`.
  - **Frontend**: A success toast is displayed. The new saved search becomes visible on the `/settings` page.

- **Deleting a Saved Search:**
  - **Trigger**: User is on the `/settings` page and clicks the delete icon next to a saved search. This is disabled if the user's account is suspended.
  - **Action**: A confirmation dialog asks the user to confirm the deletion. Upon confirmation, a request is made to update the user's profile in Firestore.
  - **Backend (Firebase)**: The user's document in the `users` collection is updated. The specific `SavedSearch` object to be deleted is removed from the `savedSearches` array field using `arrayRemove`.
  - **Frontend**: The UI updates to remove the deleted search from the list, and a success toast is shown.

## 6. Future Updates (Potential Enhancements)

- **Advanced Resume Builder**: Tools to help create or improve resumes directly on the platform.
- **Skill Assessments**: Optional tests to verify skills and earn badges for their profile.
- **Interview Preparation Tools**: Resources and AI-powered mock interviews.
- **Career Path Suggestions**: AI-driven recommendations for career growth based on profile and job market trends.
- **Direct Messaging with Recruiters**: Secure communication channel (post-application or if recruiter initiates).
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Full implementation as per `docs/notification-system-plan.md`.
- **Gamification**: Points or badges for profile completion, applications, etc.
- **Networking Features**: Ability to connect with other professionals or mentors on the platform.
- **Clearer guidance for suspended users** on how to resolve their account status.
- **Support for Multiple Choice & Checkbox Screening Questions**: Enhance the UI for job seekers to answer these types.
- For a broader look at upcoming platform features, refer to the [Future Development Roadmap](../planning/01-future-development-roadmap.md).
- Extensive AI-powered enhancements are planned, including AI Career Path Advisor and AI Job Concierge. See `docs/ai-features-roadmap.md` for the full AI vision.
