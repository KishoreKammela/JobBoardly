# JobBoardly - Future Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned future development for JobBoardly, consolidating features from various planning documents including the AI Features Roadmap, Notification System Plan, and previously listed Enhanced Feature Recommendations. The roadmap is divided into logical phases to guide iterative development.

**Crucial Prerequisite: Platform Feature Toggle Management System**

Before most new features (especially AI and Notification system enhancements) are rolled out, a robust **Platform Feature Toggle Management** system must be implemented within the Admin Panel. This system is a high-priority item for the next phase of development and will allow administrators (SuperAdmins/Admins) to:

- Enable or disable specific platform features globally.
- Potentially provide granular toggles for sub-features or specific user roles (Job Seeker, Employer).
- This system will involve backend logic for feature flags, database changes to store flag states, and checks throughout the application where features are conditionally rendered or executed.

## Phase 1: Foundational Enhancements & Core System Maturity

This phase focuses on solidifying existing features, implementing critical backend components, and preparing for more advanced functionalities.

### 1.1. Notification System - Backend Implementation

- **Objective**: Activate the currently implemented UI for in-app notifications by building the backend triggers.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Implement Firebase Functions (or similar server-side logic) to create `Notification` documents in Firestore based on key events:
    - **Job Seeker**: Application status changed by employer.
    - **Employer**: New application received, job approved/rejected by admin, company profile approved/rejected.
    - **Admin**: New job/company pending approval.
  - Develop a basic email template system and sending capability (e.g., using Firebase Extensions or a third-party service like SendGrid) for critical transactional emails:
    - Account verification (welcome email).
    - Password reset confirmations.
    - Application submission confirmations.
    - Job/Company status change notifications (approved, rejected).
  - Implement backend support for user notification preferences (currently in `/settings` UI) to control which notifications are generated.
- **Dependencies**: Admin Feature Toggle for enabling/disabling specific notification types.

### 1.2. AI Features - Full User Control & Admin Toggles

- **Objective**: Complete the implementation of already initiated AI features by adding user controls and admin toggles.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - **Dynamic Summary Generator**: Allow job seekers to trigger AI summary generation for different target roles/companies directly from their profile page (not just on initial resume parse). Integrate with Admin Feature Toggle.

## New Technologies & Third-Party Integrations (Considerations for Future Phases)

As JobBoardly scales and new features are developed, the following technologies and integrations will likely be necessary:

1.  **Backend Functions (e.g., Firebase Functions, Google Cloud Functions)**

    - **Need**: Essential for implementing the backend logic of the notification system (triggering notifications on database events), handling background tasks (e.g., advanced resume processing, periodic AI tasks), server-side validation, and complex API integrations.
    - **Purpose**: To offload server-side processing from the Next.js application, enable real-time features, automate tasks, and ensure scalability of backend operations.

2.  **Full-Text Search Engine (e.g., Algolia, Typesense, Meilisearch, Elasticsearch)**

    - **Need**: Current Firestore queries (even with client-side Genkit interpretation for boolean logic) will become slow and limited for job/candidate search as the dataset grows.
    - **Purpose**: Provide fast, relevant, typo-tolerant search results with advanced features like faceting, geo-search, and complex sorting, significantly improving user experience for job and candidate discovery.

3.  **Email Delivery Service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, Resend)**

    - **Need**: For reliable, scalable, and trackable delivery of transactional and marketing emails as outlined in the notification plan. Firebase's built-in email capabilities are limited for large-scale, feature-rich email communication.
    - **Purpose**: Ensure high email deliverability, manage templates, track engagement (opens, clicks), handle unsubscribes, and comply with anti-spam laws.

4.  **Background Job/Queue System (e.g., Cloud Tasks with Firebase Functions, BullMQ, RabbitMQ)**

    - **Need**: For handling asynchronous tasks like sending bulk notifications, intensive AI processing (e.g., video analysis, large-scale matching recalculations), data aggregation for analytics, and report generation.
    - **Purpose**: Improve application responsiveness by offloading long-running tasks, ensure reliability and retries for critical background jobs, and manage task concurrency.

5.  **Caching Layer (e.g., Redis, Memcached; or leverage Firebase Hosting CDN / Firestore caching effectively)**

    - **Need**: As the platform traffic and data volume increase, to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., popular job listings, company profiles, static site content).
    - **Purpose**: Speed up data retrieval, reduce operational costs by minimizing direct database hits, and enhance overall platform performance.

6.  **Enhanced Analytics Platform (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog, alongside Google Analytics 4)**

    - **Need**: While Vercel Analytics (based on GA4) provides good insights, a dedicated product analytics platform can offer deeper user journey analysis, funnel tracking, cohort analysis, and A/B testing capabilities crucial for measuring feature adoption and the success of various platform initiatives.
    - **Purpose**: Provide granular, data-driven insights for product development, feature prioritization, UX improvements, and measuring business KPIs.

7.  **Real-time Communication (e.g., WebSockets via Firebase Realtime Database/Firestore listeners, or dedicated services like Ably, Pusher)**

    - **Need**: For instant in-app notifications (beyond simple polling), real-time chat features (future), and live updates on dashboards.
    - **Purpose**: Enhance user engagement and provide immediate feedback on critical actions or updates.

8.  **Advanced Markdown Editor Component (Client-Side)**

    - **Need**: To provide a richer editing experience for company descriptions, job descriptions (if not fully AI-generated), and particularly for SuperAdmins managing legal content.
    - **Purpose**: Improve usability for content creation and management beyond a plain textarea. Libraries like `react-markdown` (for rendering) with `remark-gfm` are good, but for editing, Tiptap or Editor.js could be considered.

9.  **Payment Gateway Integration (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay)**

    - **Need**: If future plans include premium features for employers (e.g., featured job postings, advanced analytics access) or job seekers (e.g., premium profile features, career coaching services).
    - **Purpose**: Securely process payments for subscription services or one-time purchases.

10. **Calendar Integration APIs (e.g., Google Calendar API, Microsoft Outlook Calendar API)**
    - **Need**: For implementing interview scheduling features, allowing users to connect their calendars.
    - **Purpose**: Streamline the interview scheduling process for both employers and job seekers.

The selection and integration of these technologies should be phased according to feature development and platform growth, always considering cost, complexity, and the value they bring to JobBoardly users.
