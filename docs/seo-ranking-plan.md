# JobBoardly - SEO & Ranking Plan

## 1. Introduction

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is critical for JobBoardly's success, aiming to increase organic visibility, attract qualified job seekers and employers, and establish the platform as a leading AI-powered job portal. This plan outlines the strategies for on-page, technical, content, and off-page SEO.

## 2. Target Audience

- **Job Seekers:** Individuals actively looking for new career opportunities, researching companies, or seeking career advice. They use terms like "software engineer jobs," "marketing roles in [city]," "best companies for [skill]," "AI job matching," "resume writing tips," "interview questions for [role]."
- **Employers/Recruiters:** Companies and hiring managers looking to post job openings, find qualified candidates, and streamline their recruitment process. They use terms like "post job online," "hire developers," "candidate search platform," "AI recruitment tools," "how to write effective job descriptions," "best hiring practices."

## 3. Core SEO Pillars

- **Technical SEO:** Ensuring search engines can efficiently crawl and index the site.
- **On-Page SEO:** Optimizing individual page content and HTML for target keywords and user experience.
- **Content Strategy:** Creating valuable, relevant content that attracts, engages, and retains the target audience, naturally incorporating keywords.
- **Off-Page SEO:** Building authority, trust, and referral traffic through backlinks, brand mentions, and social signals.

## 4. Keyword Strategy

The keyword strategy will focus on a mix of head terms, body keywords, and long-tail keywords.

- **Primary Keywords (Examples):**
  - Home Page: "AI job board", "find jobs", "hire talent", "JobBoardly"
  - Job Listings: "jobs", "job search", "latest jobs"
  - Company Listings: "top companies", "companies hiring"
  - Employer Landing: "post jobs", "hire candidates", "employer job portal"
- **Secondary/Body Keywords (Examples):**
  - Job Listings: "tech jobs", "remote software jobs", "marketing manager positions"
  - Company Listings: "employer profiles", "company reviews" (if feature exists)
  - Employer Landing: "applicant tracking", "AI recruitment"
- **Long-Tail Keywords (Primarily for Content Marketing - Examples):**
  - "entry level software engineer jobs in Bangalore remote"
  - "how to write a resume for AI product manager role"
  - "best tech companies for work-life balance in India 2024"
  - "post a job for free for startups" (if applicable)
  - "common interview questions for data analysts"
  - "tips for effective remote team management for employers"

**Keyword Mapping:** Each significant page (static, dynamic, content pieces) will have a primary keyword focus, supported by relevant secondary and long-tail keywords. Dynamic pages (job details, company details) will derive their primary keywords from the specific entity. Blog posts and guides will target informational and long-tail keywords.

## 5. On-Page SEO Implementation

### 5.1. Title Tags (`<title>`)

- **Best Practices:** Unique, 50-60 characters, primary keyword near beginning, compelling, brand name at end.
- **Examples:**
  - Home: `JobBoardly - AI-Powered Job Search & Hiring Platform`
  - Job Detail: `[Job Title] at [Company] - [Location] | JobBoardly`
  - Blog Post: `[Blog Post Title] - Career Advice | JobBoardly`

### 5.2. Meta Descriptions

- **Best Practices:** Unique, 150-160 characters, include keywords, act as an "ad" for the page.
- **Examples:**
  - Home: `Find your dream job or hire top talent with JobBoardly. Our AI-driven platform offers intelligent job matching, resume parsing, and a seamless experience.`
  - Blog Post: `Learn how to [solve problem/achieve goal related to blog topic]. Expert tips and insights from JobBoardly.`

### 5.3. Header Tags (H1-H6)

- **H1 Tag:** One unique H1 per page, describes page content, includes primary keyword.
- **H2-H6 Tags:** Structure content logically, incorporate secondary keywords naturally.

### 5.4. Image Optimization

- **Alt Text:** Descriptive alt text for all images.
- **File Names:** Descriptive, keyword-rich file names.
- **Compression:** Optimize images for web (Next.js `next/image` helps).
- **`data-ai-hint`:** Used for AI-generated placeholders.

### 5.5. Internal Linking

- Strategically link to other relevant pages (jobs to companies, blog posts to feature pages or relevant job categories). Use descriptive anchor text.

### 5.6. Content Quality (Overall)

- Focus on original, high-quality, valuable, and regularly updated content.

### 5.7. Structured Data (Schema Markup)

- **Current:** `JobPosting`, `Organization`, `BreadcrumbList`, `WebSite` with `SearchAction`.
- **Future (with Content Marketing):**
  - `Article` or `BlogPosting` for blog posts.
  - `HowTo` for guides.
  - `FAQPage` for FAQ sections.
  - `Review` if/when user reviews are implemented for companies or jobs.
  - `VideoObject` if video content is produced.

### 5.8. Canonical URLs

- Use canonical tags for all pages. `metadataBase` in root layout aids this. Filtered pages should canonicalize to their unfiltered counterparts.

## 6. Technical SEO Considerations

- **Site Speed:** Continuously leverage Next.js features and monitor with PageSpeed Insights.
- **Mobile-Friendliness:** Ensure responsive design (Tailwind CSS, test with Mobile-Friendly Test).

- **HTTPS:** Standard.
- **URL Structure:** Clean, logical, keyword-friendly URLs.
- **Core Web Vitals:** Prioritize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID, or Interaction to Next Paint - INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
