# JobBoardly - SEO & Ranking Plan

## 1. Introduction

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is critical for JobBoardly's success, aiming to increase organic visibility, attract qualified job seekers and employers, and establish the platform as a leading AI-powered job portal. This plan outlines the strategies for on-page, technical, content, and off-page SEO.

## 2. Target Audience

- **Job Seekers:** Individuals actively looking for new career opportunities, researching companies, or seeking career advice. They use terms like "software engineer jobs," "marketing roles in [city]," "best companies for [skill]," "AI job matching," "resume writing tips," "interview questions for [role]."
- **Employers/Recruiters:** Companies and hiring managers looking to post job openings, find qualified candidates, and streamline their recruitment process. They use terms like "post job online," "hire developers," "candidate search platform," "AI recruitment tools," "how to write effective job descriptions," "best hiring practices."

## 3. Core SEO Pillars

- **Technical SEO:** Ensuring search engines can efficiently crawl and index the site.
- **On-Page SEO:** Optimizing individual page content and HTML for target keywords and user experience.
- **Content Strategy:** Creating valuable, relevant content that attracts, engages, and retains the target audience, naturally incorporating keywords.
- **Off-Page SEO:** Building authority, trust, and referral traffic through backlinks, brand mentions, and social signals.

## 4. Keyword Strategy

The keyword strategy will focus on a mix of head terms, body keywords, and long-tail keywords.

- **Primary Keywords (Examples):**
  - Home Page: "AI job board", "find jobs", "hire talent", "JobBoardly", "AI-powered job search"
  - Job Listings: "jobs", "job search", "latest jobs", "career opportunities"
  - Company Listings: "top companies", "companies hiring", "employer profiles"
  - Employer Landing: "post jobs", "hire candidates", "employer job portal", "AI recruitment"
  - Privacy Policy: "JobBoardly privacy policy", "data protection policy"
  - Terms of Service: "JobBoardly terms of service", "user agreement"
  - HTML Sitemap: "JobBoardly sitemap", "site navigation"
- **Secondary/Body Keywords (Examples):**
  - Job Listings: "tech jobs", "remote software jobs", "marketing manager positions", "entry-level jobs"
  - Company Listings: "company culture", "best places to work"
  - Employer Landing: "applicant tracking system", "find employees", "talent acquisition"
- **Long-Tail Keywords (Primarily for Content Marketing - Examples):**

**Keyword Mapping:** Each significant page (static, dynamic, content pieces) will have a primary keyword focus, supported by relevant secondary and long-tail keywords. Dynamic pages (job details, company details) will derive their primary keywords from the specific entity. Blog posts and guides will target informational and long-tail keywords. Public-facing pages like Home, Job Listings, Company Listings, Employer Landing, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service have been optimized with specific keywords.

## 5. On-Page SEO Implementation

### 5.1. Title Tags (`<title>`)

- **Best Practices:** Unique, 50-60 characters, primary keyword near beginning, compelling, brand name at end.
- **Examples:**
  - Home: `JobBoardly - AI-Powered Job Search & Hiring Platform`
  - Job Detail: `[Job Title] at [Company] - [Location] | JobBoardly`
  - Company Detail: `[Company Name] - Profile & Jobs | JobBoardly`
  - Employer Landing: `Employers - Post Jobs & Find Talent | JobBoardly`
  - Privacy Policy: `Privacy Policy - How JobBoardly Protects Your Data`
  - Terms of Service: `Terms of Service - JobBoardly User Agreement`
  - Blog Post (Future): `[Blog Post Title] - Career Advice | JobBoardly`

### 5.2. Meta Descriptions

- **Best Practices:** Unique, 150-160 characters, include keywords, act as an "ad" for the page.
- **Examples:**
  - Home: `Find your dream job or hire top talent with JobBoardly. Our AI-driven platform offers intelligent job matching, resume parsing, and a seamless experience for job seekers and employers.`
  - Job Listings: `Search and filter thousands of job openings on JobBoardly. Find full-time, part-time, contract, and remote jobs across various industries and locations.`
  - Employer Landing: `JobBoardly for Employers: Post job openings, manage applications, and find qualified candidates using our AI-powered tools. Streamline your hiring process today.`

  - Blog Post (Future): `Learn how to [solve problem/achieve goal related to blog topic]. Expert tips and insights from JobBoardly.`

### 5.3. Header Tags (H1-H6)

- **H1 Tag:** One unique H1 per page, describes page content, includes primary keyword. Implemented on public landing pages.
- **H2-H6 Tags:** Structure content logically, incorporate secondary keywords naturally. Implemented on public landing pages.

### 5.4. Image Optimization

- **Alt Text:** Descriptive alt text for all images. Implemented on public landing pages using `next/image` and `data-ai-hint` for placeholders.
- **File Names:** Descriptive, keyword-rich file names (managed by image source).
- **Compression:** Optimize images for web (Next.js `next/image` helps).
- **`data-ai-hint`:** Used for AI-generated placeholders to suggest relevant image themes.

### 5.5. Internal Linking

- Strategically link to other relevant pages (jobs to companies, employer landing to post job, etc.). Implemented in updated public pages and footer. HTML sitemap enhances this.

### 5.6. Content Quality (Overall)

- Focus on original, high-quality, valuable, and regularly updated content. Landing pages (Home, Employer) and legal pages have been enhanced. Future blog/guides will expand this.

### 5.7. Structured Data (Schema Markup)

- **Current (Planned/Implemented):**
  - `WebSite` with `SearchAction` (potential search box in SERPs).
  - `Organization` for JobBoardly.
  - `JobPosting` for individual job detail pages.
  - `BreadcrumbList` for navigation paths.
  - `WebPage` for static content pages like Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Sitemap.
- **Future (with Content Marketing):**

  - `FAQPage` for FAQ sections.
  - `Review` if/when user reviews are implemented for companies or jobs.
  - `VideoObject` if video content is produced.

### 5.8. Canonical URLs

- Use canonical tags for all pages. `metadataBase` in root `layout.tsx` aids this. Dynamic pages specify their canonical path. Filtered pages should canonicalize to their unfiltered counterparts (Next.js default behavior for query params usually handles this well, but monitor).

## 6. Technical SEO Considerations

- **Site Speed:** Continuously leverage Next.js features and monitor with PageSpeed Insights.
- **Mobile-Friendliness:** Ensure responsive design (Tailwind CSS, test with Mobile-Friendly Test). Implemented.
- **Crawlability & Indexability:**
  - **`sitemap.xml`:** Dynamically generated for static pages, approved jobs, and approved companies. Submittable to search engines. Implemented via `/sitemap.xml` route.
  - **`robots.txt`:** Configure to guide crawlers, disallow non-public areas (admin, user settings). Ensure content areas (blog - future) are crawlable. (To be created manually or via Next.js config).
  - **HTML Sitemap (`/sitemap`):** Provides a user-friendly navigation and helps search engines discover pages. Implemented.
- **HTTPS:** Standard.
- **URL Structure:** Clean, logical, keyword-friendly URLs are used (e.g., `/jobs/[jobId]`, `/companies/[companyId]`).
- **Core Web Vitals:** Prioritize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID, or Interaction to Next Paint - INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). (Ongoing optimization).
